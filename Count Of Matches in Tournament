//first approach
//  n teams are given .bascally if a match is played one team is the winner and another team is elimitaed
// 1 match =1 winner=1 loser (eliminated) 
// if n teams are there and 1 winner is there then n-1 teams will be eliminated  and for n-1 teams to be eliminated they would have played n-1 matches
class Solution {
    public int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        return n-1;
    }
}


//second approach
//log(n)
//follow the simulation given in question
